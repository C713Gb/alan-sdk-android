This is an example on how to integrate the Alan Android SDK into a Kotlin app, connect to the Alan Studio backend and handle callbacks. To use this app:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Explore the app in the IDE and run it.
3. Use the applied [AlanSDK_ExampleScript.txt script](https://github.com/alan-ai/alan-sdk-android/blob/master/examples/AlanSampleApp/AlanSDK_ExampleScript.txt) on the Alan Studio side.
4. In the app, tap the Alan button and give voice commands from the voice script.
